# Waitlist Landing Page Best Practices

## 🎯 Your First Startup - Key Insights

### 1. **Don't Show Exact Counts Initially**

**Why?**

- If you show "3 of 100 users joined" on day 1, it looks empty
- Early visitors might think "no one else is interested"
- Competitors can track your growth
- Low numbers can create negative social proof

**What to do instead:**

- Use vague social proof: "Join freelancers waiting for early access"
- Show milestones only: Celebrate when you hit 25, 50, 100
- Use ranges: "Join 50+ freelancers" (even if it's 23)
- Show percentage: "Over 50% full" (only when true)

### 2. **When to Show the Count**

✅ **Show it when:**

- You have 25+ signups (looks credible)
- You're close to milestones (creates urgency)
- You want to create FOMO ("Only 12 spots left!")
- You're confident in your traction

❌ **Hide it when:**

- You're just starting (0-24 signups)
- Growth is slow
- You want to avoid competitor tracking
- You're testing different messaging

### 3. **Social Proof Alternatives**

Instead of exact counts, use:

**Option 1: Vague Social Proof**

```
"Join freelancers waiting for early access"
"Be among the first to try Novba"
```

**Option 2: Milestone Celebrations**

```
"🎉 50 freelancers joined! Only 50 spots left"
"Over 75% full - Join before we close the waitlist"
```

**Option 3: Testimonials/Quotes**

```
"Finally, an invoicing tool built for freelancers" - Sarah, Designer
```

**Option 4: Urgency Without Numbers**

```
"Limited spots available"
"First 100 get lifetime access"
```

### 4. **Psychology Tips**

**Create Urgency:**

- "Only X spots left" (when you're close to 100)
- "Join before February launch"
- "Early access closes soon"

**Build Trust:**

- Show testimonials (even from friends/family initially)
- Display logos of any partners/backers
- Mention any press coverage or awards

**Reduce Friction:**

- One field only (email)
- No credit card required
- Clear value proposition
- Fast loading page

### 5. **What to Track (But Not Show)**

**Track internally:**

- Exact signup count
- Conversion rate (visitors → signups)
- Traffic sources
- Time to signup
- Drop-off points

**Show publicly:**

- Only when it helps (25+ signups)
- Milestones and celebrations
- Vague social proof

### 6. **Growth Strategy**

**Phase 1: 0-24 signups (Hide count)**

- Focus on getting first 25 signups
- Use vague social proof
- Share with friends, family, personal network
- Post in relevant communities (Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn)

**Phase 2: 25-49 signups (Optional count)**

- Can start showing count if you want
- Celebrate milestones
- Share progress updates
- Build momentum

**Phase 3: 50-99 signups (Show count)**

- Create urgency: "Only X spots left!"
- Share on social media
- Press outreach
- Influencer partnerships

**Phase 4: 100+ signups (Celebrate!)**

- Big announcement
- "Waitlist full" or "Opening to more"
- Email all signups
- Launch beta program

### 7. **Red Flags to Avoid**

❌ Showing "2 of 100 users joined" on day 1
❌ Making up fake numbers
❌ Being too aggressive with urgency
❌ Ignoring early signups (they're your biggest fans!)
❌ Not following up with waitlist members

### 8. **What Successful Startups Do**

**Notion (early days):**

- No public count
- Focused on quality over quantity
- Built community first

**Superhuman:**

- Invite-only waitlist
- Created exclusivity
- No public numbers

**Linear:**

- Showed milestones only
- Built anticipation
- Celebrated wins publicly

### 9. **Your Action Plan**

**Week 1-2:**

- Hide the counter
- Get first 25 signups from personal network
- Use vague social proof
- Test messaging

**Week 3-4:**

- Once you hit 25, decide if you want to show count
- Start sharing on social media
- Post in relevant communities
- Build momentum

**Month 2:**

- Show count if you're confident
- Create urgency as you approach 100
- Celebrate milestones
- Engage with waitlist members

### 10. **Remember**

- **Quality > Quantity**: 50 engaged users > 1000 disinterested ones
- **Early users are gold**: They'll be your biggest advocates
- **It's okay to start small**: Every big company started at 0
- **Focus on value**: Make sure your product solves a real problem
- **Be authentic**: Don't fake numbers or create false urgency

## 🚀 Quick Wins

1. **Personal Network**: Email 50 friends/colleagues asking for feedback
2. **Communities**: Share in 3-5 relevant online communities
3. **Social Media**: Post on Twitter/LinkedIn with clear value prop
4. **Product Hunt**: Prepare for a Product Hunt launch
5. **Email Sequence**: Set up automated emails for waitlist members

## 📊 Metrics to Track

- Signup conversion rate (aim for 5-10%)
- Traffic sources
- Time on page
- Bounce rate
- Email open rates (when you start emailing)

Good luck with your startup! Remember, every successful company started with 0 users. Focus on building something people actually want, and the numbers will follow. 🎉
